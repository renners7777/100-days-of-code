# 100 Days Of Code - Log

#Day 1: I completed the New Responsive Web Design "Learn HTML Forms by building a Registration Form" section and will start on my Survey Form tomorrow.
I still have a lot to learn about HTML and CSS but am getting there.

I have been learning to code for 3 months now so am not completely new to HTML and CSS.

#Day2: I spent around 1.5 hours tidying up my code on the freecodecamp survey form today. I was struggling to import/link in a background image so need to do some work on that. Will keep working on that tomorrow.
