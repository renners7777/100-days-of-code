# 100 Days Of Code - Log

#Day 1: I completed the New Responsive Web Design "Learn HTML Forms by building a Registration Form" section and will start on my Survey Form tomorrow.
I still have a lot to learn about HTML and CSS but am getting there.

I have been learning to code for 3 months now so am not completely new to HTML and CSS.

#Day2: I spent around 1.5 hours tidying up my code on the freecodecamp survey form today. I was struggling to import/link in a background image so need to do some work on that. Will keep working on that tomorrow.

#Day 3: Change of tack - I have come across #100Devs and have watched Class 01. I am really intrigued by this learning process and this it will suit me better than freecodecamp for the time being. So I am going to start working on a new project. Yes, I hear you say, this guy is really scatty! I appreciate that but this teaches you how to learn and not just how to code and that is really important so I'm going to stick with this!

#Days 4 and 5 of #100DaysOfCode:
Watched Class02 of #100Devs from 
@leonnoel. Enjoyable class learning html and designing chocolate brownie page! Today I am learning to learn using coursera website.

Day 6 of #100DaysOfCode. 
I have been Learning to Learn on Coursera specifically covering concepts such as chunking, retrieval practice, overlearning, interleaving, active recall, spaced repetition and so on. Using Anki for spaced repetition.

Day7: Had a productive day today. Completed "Learning to Learn" coursera course. Then I started ShayHowe HTML/CSS learning and started following along with the website practice to put learning into practice - using VS Code. Keeping on with Anki too. I need to learn VIM properly to keep my hands/wrists in good working order!

Day 8: Started BBC website html homework and gearing up for Class03 
@leonnoel
 later on today. Can't wait.  He is very inspirational!

Day 9: Built html only copy of bbc homepage for Class04 
@leonnoel
. Talked to fellow #100Devs colleague using Discord to discuss our html layouts before completing to get a feel for the task.

Days 10 & 11: Tidied up my bbc html homework and submitted that. Today,  Anki and ShayHowe 3-4, typing practice. Going to delay Class04 
@leonnoel
 until I've completed ShayHowe 1-12. So Class04 end of week.
 
 Day 12: Went through chapter 5 floats section in ShayHowe and have started watching Mayanwolfe Explains CSS Floats on Youtube to get a better understanding as it went in one ear and out the other! I got through lesson 2 in TypingTest.com. 
 
 Day 13: Completed Techcrunch html and Khan Academy html in Glitch and uploaded to Github. Watched Class04 Learn with Leon on CSS. Typingtest.com - Lesson 3.
 
 Day 14: Watched Mayanwolfe Explains Css Floats up to around 1.5 hour mark, read ShayHowe chapter 6, practiced my typing skills - going slowly as I am transitioning from touch typing using 2/3 fingers to touch typing using all fingers!
 
 Day 15: Read ShayHowe chapters 7-10 and completed Anki at the same time. Practiced my typing skills.
