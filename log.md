# 100 Days Of Code - Log

#Day 1: I completed the New Responsive Web Design "Learn HTML Forms by building a Registration Form" section and will start on my Survey Form tomorrow.
I still have a lot to learn about HTML and CSS but am getting there.

I have been learning to code for 3 months now so am not completely new to HTML and CSS.

#Day2: I spent around 1.5 hours tidying up my code on the freecodecamp survey form today. I was struggling to import/link in a background image so need to do some work on that. Will keep working on that tomorrow.

#Day 3: Change of tack - I have come across #100Devs and have watched Class 01. I am really intrigued by this learning process and this it will suit me better than freecodecamp for the time being. So I am going to start working on a new project. Yes, I hear you say, this guy is really scatty! I appreciate that but this teaches you how to learn and not just how to code and that is really important so I'm going to stick with this!

#Days 4 and 5 of #100DaysOfCode:
Watched Class02 of #100Devs from 
@leonnoel. Enjoyable class learning html and designing chocolate brownie page! Today I am learning to learn using coursera website.

Day 6 of #100DaysOfCode. 
I have been Learning to Learn on Coursera specifically covering concepts such as chunking, retrieval practice, overlearning, interleaving, active recall, spaced repetition and so on. Using Anki for spaced repetition.

Day7: Had a productive day today. Completed "Learning to Learn" coursera course. Then I started ShayHowe HTML/CSS learning and started following along with the website practice to put learning into practice - using VS Code. Keeping on with Anki too. I need to learn VIM properly to keep my hands/wrists in good working order!

Day 8: Started BBC website html homework and gearing up for Class03 
@leonnoel
