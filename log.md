# 100 Days Of Code - Log

#Day 1: I completed the New Responsive Web Design "Learn HTML Forms by building a Registration Form" section and will start on my Survey Form tomorrow.
I still have a lot to learn about HTML and CSS but am getting there.

I have been learning to code for 3 months now so am not completely new to HTML and CSS.
